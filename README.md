# [**Bioinformatics Tools**](https://github.com/hebamuh68/Bioinformatics-Projects/tree/main/Bioinformatics%20Tools)

This project provides solutions to some biological problems using Python.

## **Problems solved:**

1. ### **Class CMD:** 

   - Generate random fasta file

   - Search for patterns in sequence

   - Find the minimum skew of sequence and GC content percentage

   - Find most frequent patterns with specific k-mer

   - Detecting Breast Cancer.

     

2. ### ****Tools used:****

   - Python
   - ML
   - Streamlit (GUI)

------

1. ### **Generate random fasta file**

   - **Input:** Number of sequences, Range of sequences length 

   - **Output:** Fasta file

   - **Time complexity:** O(n*m), where n is the number of sequences and m is length sequence



4. ### **Search for patterns in sequence**
